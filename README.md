# network-security-homelab

This project documents my personal networking and security lab built using:

- pfSense (Firewall & Router)
- Ubuntu Server (Target / Production Server)
- Kali Linux (Attacker Machine)

## 🎯 Objective

- Learn real-world networking concepts (IP, NAT, DHCP, Routing)
- Practice firewall rules using pfSense
- Harden a Linux server using UFW & Fail2Ban
- Validate security using controlled Kali Linux scans
- Build strong fundamentals for Cloud Security, SRE, and DevSecOps roles

## 🧱 Lab Architecture

Internet  
→ pfSense (WAN - NAT)  
→ pfSense (LAN - Internal Network)  
→ Ubuntu Server & Kali Linux

## ✅ Current Status

- [x] pfSense Installed  
- [x] Ubuntu Installed  
- [x] Kali Linux Installed  
- [*] Static IP Assignment  
- [*] Firewall Rules  
- [ ] Server Hardening  
- [ ] Controlled Attack Testing  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- pfSense
- Ubuntu Server
- Kali Linux
- UFW
- Fail2Ban
- Nmap

## 📌 Notes

This lab is being built step by step with focus on:
Networking → Security → Monitoring → Cloud & DevSecOps.
